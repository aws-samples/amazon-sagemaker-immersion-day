    "Amazon SageMaker Experiments is a capability of Amazon SageMaker that lets you **organize, track, compare, and evaluate your machine learning experiments**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is an iterative process. You need to experiment with multiple combinations of data, algorithm and parameters, all the while observing the impact of incremental changes on model accuracy. Over time this iterative experimentation can result in thousands of model training runs and model versions. This makes it hard to track the best performing models and their input configurations. Itâ€™s also difficult to compare active experiments with past experiments to identify opportunities for further incremental improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker Experiments **automatically tracks the inputs, parameters, configurations, and results of your iterations as trials. You can assign, group, and organize these trials into experiments**. SageMaker Experiments is integrated with Amazon SageMaker Studio providing a visual interface to browse your active and past experiments, compare trials on key performance metrics, and identify the best performing models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because SageMaker Experiments enables tracking of all the steps and artifacts that went into creating a model, you can quickly revisit the origins of a model when you are troubleshooting issues in production, or auditing your models for compliance verifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker Experiments comes with its own Experiments Python SDK which makes the analytics capabilities easily accessible in Amazon SageMaker Notebooks. You can install this by running `pip install sagemaker-experiments`. \n",

    "In this notebook, we will run a few training jobs with the XGBoost Estimator built-in into Amazon SageMaker and track some of its metrics via SageMaker Experiments. Note that in this notebook we only focus on Training and Tuning jobs, however SM Experiments is also compatible with pre-processing jobs via SageMaker Processing, batch inferences with SageMaker Batch Transform, and pipelines built with SageMaker Pipelines.\n",

Examples of trial components are data pre-processing jobs, training jobs, and batch transform jobs.\n",
