    "## Background\n",
    "Direct marketing, either through mail, email, phone, etc., is a common tactic to acquire customers.  Because resources and a customer's attention is limited, the goal is to only target the subset of prospects who are likely to engage with a specific offer.  Predicting those potential customers based on readily available information like demographics, past interactions, and environmental factors is a common machine learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents an example problem to predict if a customer will enroll for a term deposit at a bank, after one or more phone calls.  The steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Preparing your Amazon SageMaker notebook\n",
    "* Downloading data from the internet into Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "* Investigating and transforming the data so that it can be fed to Amazon SageMaker algorithms\n",
    "* Estimating a model using the Gradient Boosting algorithm\n",
    "* Evaluating the effectiveness of the model\n",

In a typical SageMaker workflow, notebooks are only used for prototyping and can be run on relatively inexpensive and less powerful instances, while processing, training and model hosting tasks are run on separate, more powerful SageMaker-managed instances.  SageMaker Processing includes off-the-shelf support for Scikit-learn, as well as a Bring Your Own Container option, so it can be used with many different data transformation technologies and tasks.    \n",

For this example, we're using a SageMaker prebuilt Scikit-learn container, which includes many common functions for processing data.  There are few limitations on what kinds of code and operations you can run, and only a minimal contract:  input and output data must be placed in specified directories.  If this is done, SageMaker Processing automatically loads the input data from S3 and uploads transformed data back to S3 when the job is complete."

To find the best values for these hyperparameters, you can specify ranges of values that Amazon SageMaker hyperparameter tuning searches to find the combination of values that results in the training job that performs the best as measured by the objective metric that you chose.
