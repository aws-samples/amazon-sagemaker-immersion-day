    "Here, we'll show how to bring your docker cotainer that packages your environment and code. We showcase the [decision tree](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html) algorithm from the widely used [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) machine learning package. The example is purposefully fairly trivial since the point is to show the surrounding structure that you'll want to add to your own container so you can bring it to Amazon SageMaker for training and hosting.\n",

    "In this lab, we use a single image to support both model training and hosting for simplicity. Sometimes you’ll want separate images for training and hosting because they have different requirements. \n",

    "1. **Building the container** - We walk through the different components of the containers and inspect the docker file. Then we build and push the container to ECR. \n",
    "2. **Setup & Upload Data** - Once our container is built and registered. We ready sagemaker and upload the data to S3. \n",
    "3. **Model Training** - Create a training job using SageMaker Python SDK. It will pull data from S3 and use the container we built.  \n",
    "4. **Model Deployment** - Once training is complete, deploy our model to a HTTP endpoint using SageMaker Python SDK. \n",

    "- `Dockerfile` describes how to build your Docker container image. More details below.\n",
    "- `build_and_push.sh` is a script that uses the Dockerfile to build your container images and then pushes it to ECR. We’ll invoke the commands directly later in this notebook, but you can just copy and run the script for your own algorithms.\n",
    "- `local_test` is a directory that shows how to test your new container on any computer that can run Docker, including an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance. Using this method, you can quickly iterate using small datasets to eliminate any structural bugs before you use the container with Amazon SageMaker. Testing is not the focus of this lab, but feel free to checkout the example at your own time.  \n",
    "- `decision_trees` is the directory which contains the files that will be installed in the container.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this simple application, we only install five files in the container. These five show the standard structure of our Python containers, although you are free to choose a different toolset or programming language and therefore could have a different layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "The files that we’ll put in the container are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `nginx.conf` is the configuration file for the nginx front-end. Generally, you should be able to take this file as-is.\n",
    "- `predictor.py` is the program that actually implements the Flask web server and the decision tree predictions for this app. You’ll want to customize the actual prediction parts to your application. Since this algorithm is simple, we do all the processing here in this file, but you may choose to have separate files for implementing your custom logic.\n",
    "- `serve` is the program started when the container is started for hosting. It simply launches the gunicorn server which runs multiple instances of the Flask app defined in predictor.py. You should be able to take this file as-is.\n",
    "- `train` is the program that is invoked when the container is run for training. You will modify this program to implement your training algorithm.\n",
    "- `wsgi.py` is a small wrapper used to invoke the Flask app. You should be able to take this file as-is.\n",
