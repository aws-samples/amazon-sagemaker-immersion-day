    "## Overview\n",
    "Here, we’ll show how to package a simple Python example which showcases the decision tree algorithm from the widely used scikit-learn machine learning package. The example is purposefully fairly trivial since the point is to show the surrounding structure that you’ll want to add to your own code so you can train and host it in Amazon SageMaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideas shown here will work in any language or environment. You’ll need to choose the right tools for your environment to serve HTTP requests for inference, but good HTTP environments are available in every language these days.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use a single image to support training and hosting. This is easy because it means that we only need to manage one image and we can set it up to do everything. Sometimes you’ll want separate images for training and hosting because they have different requirements. Just separate the parts discussed below into separate Dockerfiles and build two images. Choosing whether to have a single image or two images is really a matter of which is more convenient for you to develop and manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’re only using Amazon SageMaker for training or hosting, but not both, there is no need to build the unused functionality into your container."

    "Docker provides a simple way to package arbitrary code into an image that is totally self-contained. Once you have an image, you can use Docker to run a container based on that image. Running a container is just like running a program on the machine except that the container creates a fully self-contained environment for the program to run. Containers are isolated from each other and from the host environment, so the way you set up your program is the way it runs, no matter where you run it.\n",

Since this algorithm is simple, we do all the processing here in this file, but you may choose to have separate files for implementing your custom logic.\n",
