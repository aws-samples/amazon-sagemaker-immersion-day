We showcase the [decision tree](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html) algorithm from the widely used [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/) machine learning package. The example is purposefully fairly trivial since the point is to show the surrounding structure that you'll want to add to your own container so you can bring it to Amazon SageMaker for training and hosting.\n",

    "- `local_test` is a directory that shows how to test your new container on any computer that can run Docker, including an Amazon SageMaker notebook instance. Using this method, you can quickly iterate using small datasets to eliminate any structural bugs before you use the container with Amazon SageMaker. Testing is not the focus of this lab, but feel free to checkout the example at your own time.  \n",

    "\n",
    "- `nginx.conf` is the configuration file for the nginx front-end. Generally, you should be able to take this file as-is.\n",
    "- `predictor.py` is the program that actually implements the Flask web server and the decision tree predictions for this app. You’ll want to customize the actual prediction parts to your application. Since this algorithm is simple, we do all the processing here in this file, but you may choose to have separate files for implementing your custom logic.\n",
    "- `serve` is the program started when the container is started for hosting. It simply launches the gunicorn server which runs multiple instances of the Flask app defined in predictor.py. You should be able to take this file as-is.\n",
    "- `train` is the program that is invoked when the container is run for training. You will modify this program to implement your training algorithm.\n",
