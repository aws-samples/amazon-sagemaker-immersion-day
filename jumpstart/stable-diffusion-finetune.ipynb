    "Welcome to Amazon [SageMaker JumpStart](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/studio-jumpstart.html)! You can use JumpStart to solve many Machine Learning tasks through one-click in SageMaker Studio, or through [SageMaker JumpStart API](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#use-prebuilt-models-with-sagemaker-jumpstart).  In this demo notebook, we demonstrate how to use the JumpStart API to generate images from text using state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion models. Furthermore, we show how to fine-tune the model to your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stable Diffusion is a text-to-image model that enables you to create photorealistic images from just a text prompt. A diffusion model trains by learning to remove noise that was added to a real image. This de-noising process generates a realistic image. These models can also generate images from text alone by conditioning the generation process on the text. For instance, Stable Diffusion is a latent diffusion where the model learns to recognize shapes in a pure noise image and gradually brings these shapes into focus if the shapes match the words in the input text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training and deploying large models and running inference on models such as Stable Diffusion is often challenging and include issues such as cuda out of memory, payload size limit exceeded and so on.  JumpStart simplifies this process by providing ready-to-use scripts that have been robustly tested. Furthermore, it provides guidance on each step of the process including the recommended instance types, how to select parameters to guide image generation process, prompt engineering etc. Moreover, you can deploy and run inference on any of the 80+ Diffusion models from JumpStart without having to write any piece of your own code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In his notebook, you will learn how to use JumpStart to fine-tune the Stable Diffusion model to your dataset. This can be useful when creating art, logos, custom designs, NFTs, and so on, or fun stuff such as generating custom AI images of your pets or avatars of yourself.\n",

    "Although creating impressive images can find use in industries ranging from art to NFTs and beyond, today we also expect AI to be personalizable. JumpStart provides fine-tuning capability to the pre-trained models so that you can adapt the model to your own use case with as little as five training images. This can be useful when creating art, logos, custom designs, NFTs, and so on, or fun stuff such as generating custom AI images of your pets or avatars of yourself. In this lab, we learned how to fine-tune a stable diffusion text to image generation model. To learn more about Stable Diffusion fine-tuning, please check out the blog [Fine-tune text-to-image Stable Diffusion models with Amazon SageMaker JumpStart](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/fine-tune-text-to-image-stable-diffusion-models-with-amazon-sagemaker-jumpstart/)."
